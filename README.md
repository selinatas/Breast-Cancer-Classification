# Breast-Cancer-Classification
This machine-learning project classifies breast cancer as benign or malignant without using any ML
libraries. The project utilizes a dataset with 569 patient cases and 30 features related to breast cancer. We
conducted many steps, including loading and preprocessing the dataset, conducting exploratory data
analysis, implementing and evaluating a logistic regression model with and without k-fold cross-validation,
implementing a multi-layer perceptron algorithm, implementing a random forest algorithm, followed by a
comparison of these models to determine the optimal algorithm.
